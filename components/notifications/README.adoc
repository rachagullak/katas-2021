= Notifications

== Proposed Changes

This component is a good candidate to separate from the monolith for `maintainability` and `testability`.
This be made completely async by `streaming` the transactional data to synthesize a rule based notification triggers
and their maintenance.

== Open Questions

. Can this be made completely async by streaming the transaction
. Do any of the existing issues are originating out of the status quo of this component?
