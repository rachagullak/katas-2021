= Reporting

== Proposed Changes

This component is a good candidate to separate from the monolith for `performance optimization`, `maintainability` and `testability`.
Good approach here is to build a `Datalake` out of the transactional data and build reporting tools of this data.

== Open Questions

. Do any of the existing issues are originating out of the status quo of this component?
